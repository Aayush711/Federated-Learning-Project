# Federated_Learning
Federated Learning is a machine learning approach that allows a model to be trained across multiple decentralized devices or servers holding local data samples, without exchanging them. Instead of sharing raw data, only model updates are sent back to a central server, ensuring data privacy. It's useful for sensitive data (like healthcare records), edge devices, and scenarios with limited bandwidth. Challenges include communication overhead and data distribution. It finds applications in healthcare, finance, IoT, and personalized predictions. Ongoing research is focused on addressing its challenges and expanding its use cases.

## Key Features:

- Demonstrates Federated Learning with the EMNIST dataset.
- Utilizes TensorFlow and TensorFlow Federated for implementation.
- Provides examples of data preprocessing, model creation, and training on federated data.
- Visualizes training progress using TensorBoard.

## Dependencies

- TensorFlow
- TensorFlow Federated
- Matplotlib

To install the dependencies, run the following commands in your environment:

```python
!pip install --quiet --upgrade tensorflow
!pip install --quiet --upgrade tensorflow-federated
```

## Loading the Dataset
The EMNIST dataset consists of handwritten character digits. It is downloaded and prepared for training in the code.

```python
emnist_train, emnist_test = tff.simulation.datasets.emnist.load_data()
```

## Example of Data Received by a Client
This section provides an example of the data a client receives from the dataset.

## Train Client Model (Local Model)
This section demonstrates how the model is trained on each client's data locally.

## Preprocessing the Input Data
This section preprocesses the input data before it is used for training.

## Creating a Model with Keras
The model architecture used for this Federated Learning project is based on a Keras Sequential model with Dense layers.

## Training the Model on Federated Data
This section covers the training process on federated data. It uses a weighted federated averaging algorithm.

## Result of Loss and Accuracy
The code provides the result in terms of a matrix, displaying loss and accuracy metrics.

## Visualizing Training Progress
The training progress is visualized using TensorBoard, with scalar summaries for each training round.
